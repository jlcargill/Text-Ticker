Text-Ticker
===========

A java program that scrolls text across the screen much like a stock ticker.

The text is read from a file and is displayed across the screen.
The text file needs to be located in the same directory as the jar file. The file is called ticker.txt, but you can change
the code to make it anything you want. I will be adding the options to select a file, font style, font size, font color, and
background color, but for now it will have to be set in the class before the build.
